# EDC Samples

This repository provides samples for the Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) project, that aim to support the
onboarding process for new community members. The samples are incremental, so e.g. sample 3 uses code from sample 2,
and serve as a step-by-step guide for getting familiar with the project. The code and a detailed documentation
for each sample reside in the respective module.

The samples assume a working knowledge of the EDC nomenclature. If you do not know about the EDC nomenclature we
strongly advise reading the documentation and/or watching the introductory video.

Also, a working knowledge of Git, Gradle, Java and HTTP is presumed.

## Getting started

We'll assume that you've just checked out the samples code base and have Java 11+ installed on your development machine.
If not, please download and install JDK 11+ for your OS.

Command examples in this document will use the `bash` syntax and use Unix-style paths, but any other shell should be
fine as well. If you're using Windows you either need to adapt the paths or use WSL2.

Please simply follow the following links to the respective samples.

> _Please note that the entire Eclipse Dataspace Components project is under heavy development, so things are likely
> to change significantly in the future. Be sure to check back regularly to stay updated!_
